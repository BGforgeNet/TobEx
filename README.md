# Throne of Bhaal Extender

TobEx (Throne of Bhaal Extender) is a dynamic link library (DLL) written in C++ that fixes game engine bugs and extends the game engine for players and modders by modifying the virtual image of the Throne of Bhaal `BGMain.exe` in memory.

Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal version 26498 is required.

A redistributable version of TobEx identical to the "TobEx - Core" component of this modification may be packaged within other modifications.
